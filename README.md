The image is 1.jpg <br>

To use your own images copy and paste it into the folder and name it "1" then delete any other images in the folder. You are then free to run the code. <br>

To download the model click https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/3.0.0-pretrained/resnet50-19c8e357.pth/ <br>

**FOR THE IMAGE DETECTION** <br>
The initial Starting image is image.jpg <br>

The image after the detection is imagenew.jpg <br>
To use your own images copy and paste it into the folder and name it "image" then delete any images that have already been through the code. You are then free to run the code. <br>
